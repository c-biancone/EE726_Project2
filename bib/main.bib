The proposed dynamic comparator employs ten transistors with only one cross-coupled latch to reduce the circuit complexity. The parallel clocked input switches reduce parasitic resistance in the latch ground path that results in a significant decrease in latch delay time. In addition, a symmetric, three stacked transistor, single stage architecture reduces the process variation effects, increases input sensitivity and provides more head room for low power-supply applications. The proposed design is implemented in 90 nm CMOS with 1.2 V power supply and 0.6 V reference voltage, and it provides 30 μV resolution, 105.6 μW power consumption at 2 GHz clock frequency.},

The technique is implemented in a parameterized Verilog-A model and can be applied to any type of comparator.

   abstract = {Schmitt Triggers have found wide spread use in low-power and threshold-based applications such as peak detectors and spectrum analyzers. They are formed by comparators and feedback loops and exhibit hysteresis at nominal supply voltage. When using dynamic comparators, the periodic discharge of internal capacitors prior to each decision process cancels hysteresis. In addition, dynamic comparators produce considerable noise that may affect the operation of hysteresis-based applications. Therefore, currently, Schmitt Triggers are mainly designed as static circuits at the price of less operation speed, more silicon area and higher power consumption compared to their analog counterparts. This paper presents a new low-noise dynamic comparator with programmable hysteresis. Using an advanced comparator structure, as the two-stage dual-clock latch comparator, the hysteresis could be adjusted over more than 30 mV by programming the delay between the two clocks. Moreover, the same delay has been used to reduce the switching noise. The peak kickback noise is then reduced by more than 70%. This has been achieved by designing a customized 4-bit programmable delay circuit. Although several functionalities have been added to the circuit, the proposed design include only a few extra elements with respect to the basic one. As a result, the total consumed energy at 500 MHz is 1.2 pJ/decision only, while the static power consumption is less than 65 pW.},

Although the principles of adiabatic operation are well understood in digital circuits, analog and mixed-signal circuit implementations are largely unexplored. This work shows that the strongARM comparator can take advantage of adiabatic principles by i) being powered by a sine-wave, the power-clock, rather than the conventional DC power supply, VDD, and ii) using an adiabatic buffer as the output stage, rather than an SR-latch. Post-layout simulations in a 65nm technology show that the adiabatically driven strongARM has similar characteristics to the traditional strongARM: +2% noise, +0.1% input offset voltage, and the same regeneration time-constant, while only consuming between 28% and 55% of the energy of the traditional strongARM, in the typical case.},

   abstract = {<p>Comparator hysteresis is a memory phenomenon allowing outputs maintaining their past stable states until the input difference overcomes a given threshold voltage. In some applications, such as ADCs and memories, hysteresis is a deterministic error that should be minimized. In others, it can be considered as one of the design parameters, such as in implementing hysteresis control-based systems such as peak detectors and spectrum analyzers. In any case, the designer should be aware of how to estimate hysteresis to achieve the desired performances. This paper presents a mathematical approach to estimate hysteresis in clocked latch comparators. It has been demonstrated that hysteresis is not only sensitive to the clock frequency, but also to several design parameters including the transistors sizes, the common mode input voltage and the tracked input frequencies. The analysis results are validated through electrical simulations using a commercially available 0.18[Formula: see text][Formula: see text]m CMOS technology showing a maximum error of 8.6%.</p>},

   abstract = {Recent research has focused on finding ways to control hysteresis of dynamic comparators. The current proposed techniques are based on either geometrical dimension adjustment or digital control. The first case does not allow for post fabrication control, while the second has limited accuracy. This paper presents a new dynamic comparator design with external hysteresis adjustment using an analog voltage. This is achieved by proposing an architecture including control devices with a specific sizing. This is performed with no significant increase of the design complexity, keeping the power consumption as low as possible. The design is analyzed, showing that the proposed solution allows accurate hysteresis adjustment without affecting the inherent circuit properties. The dynamic comparator is also implemented using a 180 nm commercially available CMOS technology. The results show that a variation of 550 mV of the control voltage allows an accurate hysteresis adjustment ranging from 0 to 40 mV, according to the input conditions. Moreover, the simplicity of the circuit in conjunction with the use of dynamic technology have allowed the best performances to be achieved compared to the current state of the art, in terms of energy with an FoM equal to 116 fJ/decision and silicon area of 180 μm2.},

Without using special fabrication technologies, the supply voltage of the circuit is reduced to 1 V. Due to the utilization of CMOS back-gate technique, the input range of the comparators is greatly improved. The comparators are composed of bulk-driven stage and dynamic latch. By using a CMOS n-well technology, the results of HSPICE simulations indicate that the response time of Type-I circuit is 1 μs under 10 mV identified resolution.

Moreover, the proposed circuit incorporates a rail‐to‐rail offset cancellation circuit. The offset cancellation circuit works based on a time domain bulk‐tuned negative feedback loop. The proposed comparator and offset cancellation circuits are designed to work correctly when the input common mode voltage varies from rail to rail. The rail‐to‐rail scheme allows the use of the proposed comparator in nanometer technologies, where the acceptable input range is limited. The proposed circuit was simulated in a standard 180 nm complementary metal‐oxide‐semiconductor technology, and the results proved the rail‐to‐rail comparison ability in addition to the rail‐to‐rail offset cancellation function. The overall power consumption of the comparator was only increased by 11% compared with the conventional non–rail‐to‐rail approach.

However, both are suitable and actually aimed for ultra low-voltage (ULV) and/or ultra low-power (ULP) applications. The proposed comparator designs have been extensively analyzed for robustness and parameter stability across all fabrication process corners, wide temperature range (from −20 °C to 85 °C) and for random process variations as well. Both presented comparator designs can reliably operate with power consumption in nano-watt range without any fuse trimming or calibration, as the proof of concept has been confirmed by measurements performed on chip prototypes.},

   abstract = {The effective transconductance (Gm) of a bulk-driven operational amplifier (opamp) can significantly vary with the input common-mode voltage. This variation of Gm complicates frequency compensation and creates harmonic distortion. Thus, this brief presents a Gm-stabilizing technique to reduce the variation of Gm across the input common-mode range (ICMR). The idea is to use a variable positive feedback structure to adaptively control Gm to the input common-mode voltage. A low-voltage bulk-driven opamp with the proposed Gm-stabilizing technique has been implemented in a 0.18-μm n-well CMOS process. The opamp consumes 261 μW from a 900-mV supply voltage. The variation of Gm is reduced from 132% to 25% across the rail-to-rail ICMR. The measured dc gain is 76.8 dB and the unity-gain bandwidth is 7.11 MHz when the opamp is loaded with 17pF∥1 MΩ.},

The circuit was designed in a standard twin-well 130 nm CMOS technology and is intended to work in temperature range of -20 - 85 °C with the power supply voltage of 0.6 V. The proposed comparator can handle the input voltage within the rail-to-rail range. Low-voltage design approaches, namely, g m /I D design methodology in combination with the bulk-driven operation approach have been employed. The measurements on fabricated prototype chips included evaluation of both static as well as dynamic parameters. An excellent correlation between simulations and the measured bench data was observed. The proposed comparator is currently being reviewed and re-designed for even lower power supply voltage of 0.4 V.},

The term "StrongARM" commemorates the use of this circuit in Digital Equipment Corporation's StrongARM microprocessor [1], but the basic structure was originally introduced by Toshiba's Kobayashi et al. [2]. The StrongARM latch has become popular for three reasons: 1) it consumes zero static power, 2) it directly produces rail-to-rail outputs, and 3) its input-referred offset arises from primarily one differential pair.

The topology, unlike the others in the literature, uses only 2-inputs NAND gates and is able to operate with supply voltages as low as 0.15V. A detailed theoretical analysis based on transistor level modeling is provided to explain the operating principle and highlight the performance advantages of the proposed comparator. The circuit has been tested through several simulations, including corner analysis and Monte Carlo runs, by using three different technologies: 180 nm, 130 nm and 28 nm for both a supply voltage of 0.3 V and 0.15 V. The results found not only confirm the robustness of the proposed comparator, but also demonstrate very advantageous performances. Indeed, for the same technology node it exhibits the highest speed and the lowest EDP (about ten times lower than the one of the others standard-cell-based comparators in the literature). It exhibits also the lowest power consumption and silicon area.},

The circuit consists of n constant-gm rail-to-rail common-mode operational transconductance amplifier followed by a regenerative latch in a track and latch configuration to achieve a relatively constant delay. The use of a track and latch minimizes the total number of gain stages required for a given resolution. Potential offset from the constant-gm differential input stage, estimated as the main source of offset, can be minimized by proper choice of transistors sizes. Simulation results show that the circuit requires less than 86 p4 with a supply voltage of 1.65 V in a standard CMOS 0.18 p digital process. The average delay is less than 1 ns and is approximately independent of the common-mode input voltage.},

   abstract = {The paper addresses a re-design and parameter analysis of a current-mode rail-to-rail voltage comparator with power consumption in nano-watt range across all PVT corners. The comparator design was done in general-purpose 65 nm CMOS technology with the nominal power supply voltage of 1.2 V. The circuit design needs to function properly in industrial temperature range, which is from -20°C to 85°C. The rail-to-rail input voltage range is achieved without employing two differential pairs and also without an internal voltage biasing circuitry. Furthermore, the design process can be easily automated by means of calculation spreadsheet and employing gm/ID design methodology. The presented comparator has been analyzed for robustness and accuracy across all PVT corners using post-layout extracted netlist. A number of parameters was investigated by Monte-Carlo analysis. The power consumption does not exceed 1 μW in the worst-case scenario, however in typical conditions, it remains below the first third of nano-watt range. The circuit also contains enable signal to minimize the power consumption when the circuit's function is not required. The topology itself, exhibits a promising potential for further research, since it can also work in ultra low-voltage regime thanks to only two stacked transistors.},
